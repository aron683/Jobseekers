Forex, short for "foreign exchange," refers to the global marketplace for buying and selling currencies. It's the largest and most liquid financial market in the world, with daily trading volumes exceeding $7 trillion as of 2023.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how forex works:


---

1. What Is Traded in Forex?

Currencies are traded in pairs, such as:

EUR/USD (Euro vs US Dollar)

USD/JPY (US Dollar vs Japanese Yen)

GBP/USD (British Pound vs US Dollar)


You are buying one currency and simultaneously selling another. For example, if you buy EUR/USD, you are buying euros and selling US dollars.
